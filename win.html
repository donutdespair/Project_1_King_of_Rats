Zombies... I've seen it once before in a rat, and I see it now in men.
Once one gets a taste for its own kind, it can spread through the pack like a wildfire.
Mindlessly chomping and biting at their own hinds. Nothing but the taste of flesh on their minds.
You know the thing about a rat? It's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes like a doll's eyes.
Don't seem to be living at all when it come at ya. Till it bites ya.
And then the eyes roll over white. You don't hear nothing but the screaming and the hollering...

Charlie Kelly: Okay, I just killed three very large rats that were stuck in glue traps.
Dennis Reynolds: Good work.
Charlie Kelly: No. No, no, that's not good work. I am done with rat detail. That's by far the worst job in the bar.
Dennis Reynolds: That's why we call it Charlie Work.


Charlie Kelly:

Charlie: It's like whole generations of those things have died at my hands. Mothers, fathers, grandfathers, little baby rats.
Dee: Well, you know, keep up the good work.
Charlie: Sometimes, I wonder though, if our lives are reaaly more valuable than theirs. You know what I mean?
Dennis: Yeah they are. Our lives definitely are without a doubt.
