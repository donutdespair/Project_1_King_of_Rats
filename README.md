# Project_1_King_of_Rats
GA WDI NYC Project One



**Instructions:**

You have entered an abandoned subway station overrun with over caffeinated super rats. Smash (click) more than 30 in a minute to win.

**MVP:**

A new, New York subway based take on the classic carnival game Whack-a-Mole. On start, a timer ticks down from 60 and rat images appear at random in specified locations (unmarked but where rats consistently appear). Points are awarded on successful clicks. You win if you can score more than 30 points in a minute. On win or lose, you have the option to restart.

**User stories:**

I want to create a game based on a classic game with clear, simple rules.

I want to create a game that is fun to play, a little challenging, and obsessively playable like those games that came on old Mac floppies (the actually floppy ones).

**Process:**
I started with a different story based game and realized after sinking 20 hours that it was likely I would not be able to finish this game in the allotted time. I admitted defeat and switched gears to create a game with simple rules and a clear objective. I drew on methods learned in previous lessons and made an initial draft of the game with visible holes (like those of a carnival based Whack-a-Mole game) and one type of rat. In a revision, I switched the game board to be the Chambers Street Station and added nine different rats.# Project_1_King_of_Rats
